# 📰 Fake News Detection in Arabic and English

A Natural Language Processing (NLP) project to classify news articles as **fake** or **real** in **both Arabic and English** using advanced transformer-based models. This system helps combat misinformation by analyzing news content through fine-tuned models like AraBERT and BERT, offering robust multilingual support.

---


## 📌 Overview
This project detects fake news using:
- Transformer-based models (`AraBERT` for Arabic and `BERT` for English)
- TF-IDF with classical ML algorithms
- Data preprocessing pipelines for both English and Arabic
- Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python
- HuggingFace Transformers
- AraBERT, BERT
- scikit-learn
- pandas, NumPy
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

---

## ✨ Features
- 🔤 Multi-language support (Arabic and English)
- 🧹 Arabic preprocessing (normalization, lemmatization, stopword removal)
- 🤖 Model comparison: classical ML vs. transformer-based models
- 📊 Confusion matrix and metric-based evaluation

---

## 🧠 Methodology

The project follows a two-branch methodology for fake news detection in both **Arabic** and **English**:

### 🔄 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Arabic:**
  - Text normalization (removing diacritics, elongation, punctuation)
  - Stopword removal
  - Tokenization using AraBERT tokenizer
- **English:**
  - Lowercasing and punctuation removal
  - Tokenization using BERT tokenizer or TF-IDF vectorization

### 🧪 2. Model Training & Evaluation
- **Classical Machine Learning**
  - TF-IDF + SVM / Logistic Regression
- **Transformer-Based Models**
  - Fine-tuning **AraBERT** for Arabic
  - Fine-tuning **BERT** for English

### 📊 3. Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix

## 📈 Results

| Language | Model           | Accuracy | F1 Score |
|----------|------------------|----------|----------|
| Arabic   | AraBERT          | 0.92     | 0.91     |
| Arabic   | TF-IDF + SVM     | 0.85     | 0.84     |
| English  | BERT             | 0.93     | 0.92     |
| English  | TF-IDF + Logistic Regression | 0.88     | 0.87     |

> Transformer models significantly outperformed traditional TF-IDF-based classifiers, especially in handling semantic nuance in both Arabic and English.

## ⚠️ Limitations

- ⚖️ **Imbalanced datasets** may affect classification performance, particularly recall on the minority class.
- 💻 **Computational requirements** are high for transformer models, especially on large datasets.
- 🌐 **Arabic NLP** remains complex due to rich morphology and lack of high-quality pre-cleaned datasets.
- 🔍 Model interpretability is limited — transformers are often black boxes.

---

## 🔮 Future Work

- 🧠 Integrate **Explainable AI (XAI)** techniques (e.g., LIME, SHAP) to enhance transparency in predictions.
- 🌍 Extend support to other languages (e.g., French, Urdu) with multilingual transformers like XLM-R.
- 🌐 Deploy the model using **Flask** or **Streamlit** for interactive fake news classification.
- 🧪 Experiment with **ensemble techniques** that combine classical and deep models.
- 📊 Incorporate **real-time news streams** for live detection and performance testing.
